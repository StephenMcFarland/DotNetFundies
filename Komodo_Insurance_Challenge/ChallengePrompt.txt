Morning Challenge:

Komodo Insurance requires an app that allows a customer to enter their user information 
and receive their monthly premium. Komodo wants to be able to track users by their name,
age, gender, and vehicle information which includes make, model, year, and mileage.

Komodo charges their customers $75.00 if they are 25 or older and $125.00 if they are under.
Cars over 50,000 miles are charged and extra $25.00 while cars over 100,000 are charged an extra $50.00.
If the customer has had an accident in the last two years they will be charged another $25.00.

They would like a menu that allows the customer to register, view, and update their information,
as well the option to exit the application.

Komodo also requires any repository methods be tested.

Bonus items:
Allow the customer to register multiple cars.
